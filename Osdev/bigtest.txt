An operating system (OS) provides the
interface between the users of a computer
and that computer’s hardware.
– An operating system manages the ways
applications access the resources in a computer,
including its disk drives, CPU, main memory, input
devices, output devices, and network interfaces.
– An operating system manages multiple users.
– An operating system manages multiple programs.
The Kernel
• The kernel is the core component of
the operating system. It handles the
management of low-level hardware
resources, including memory,
processors, and input/output (I/O)
devices, such as a keyboard, mouse,
or video display.
• Most operating systems define the
tasks associated with the kernel in
terms of a layer metaphor, with the
hardware components, such as the
CPU, memory, and input/output
devices being on the bottom, and
users and applications being on the
top.
x86

x86
x86 is a backwards compatible family of little-endian, complex instruction set architectures (ISA) introduced in 1978 by Intel[1]. 
The iterations of the ISA can be broadly classified by integer width:
~16-bit x86, also referred to as x86_16 or IA-16 (introduced with the Intel 8086 in 1978)

~32-bit x86, also referred to as x86_32 or IA-32 (introduced with the Intel 386 in 1985)

~64-bit x86 (not to be confused with IA-64), also referred to as x86_64, AMD64 or x64. 
It is also referred to as EM64T, IA-32e or Intel64 by Intel.

The first iteration of the x86 architecture was introduced in 1978 with the 8086.
 The 8086 was a 16-bit CPU, with 16-bit registers, a 16-bit data bus and a 20-bit address bus. 
 Thus it was able to address one megabyte of RAM. 
 Slightly later, the 8088 CPU was introduced, which was internally identical to the 8086, but had a 8-bit data bus. 
 The 8088 was used by the original IBM PC, introduced in 1981, which was the predecessor of all modern PCs. 
 Thus, the x86 architecture became the dominant architecture on personal computers.
